# RongtaRLS1100-Scale-API
This project provides a .NET 8.0 Web API solution for connecting to and retrieving sales data from the Rongta RLS-1100 Weighing Scale. The API communicates with the weighing scale over a local network, reads transaction data (sales records), and saves it into a MySQL database using Entity Framework Core.
